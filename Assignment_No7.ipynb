    "## 2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "Ans: Regular expressions use the backslash character ('\\') to indicate special forms (Metacharacters) or to allow special characters (speical sequences) to be used without invoking their special meaning. This collides with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals. Hence, Raw strings are used (e.g. r\"\\n\") so that backslashes do not have to be escaped."
